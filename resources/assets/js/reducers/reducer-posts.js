Major fast-fashion brands are also catching on: H&amp;M, which released\u00a0its first Conscious Collection about five\u00a0years ago, is going a step further by designing a dress made from a new material known as\u00a0Bionic Yarn. Created using\u00a0recycled polyester made from\u00a0plastic shoreline waste\u00a0such as garbage bags and plastic bottles, the dress is a delicate pliss\u00e9 pleated blush gown that looks straight off a designer runway, particularly when modeled by ever-sophisticated model Natalia Vodianova.
